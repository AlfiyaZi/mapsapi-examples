    The link to the route editor is located in the <a href="/maps/doc/jsapi/2.1/ref/reference/router.Route.xml#editor">editor</a> field of the instance of the router.Route class that will be passed as a parameter to the <sa href="util.Promise"/> object after the route is built.
</p>
<p>
    The editor can only be turned on (off) inside the function that will be executed when the result comes from the server.
