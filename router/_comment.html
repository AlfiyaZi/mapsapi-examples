<p>
	For building a <a href="/maps/doc/jsapi/2.1/dg/concepts/router.xml">route</a>, use the <sa href="route"/> function. Pass this function an array of points that the route should pass through, along with additional options for building the route, if needed.
</p>
<p>
	The route is calculated asynchronously (i.e. while executing the 'route' function, data is exchanged with the server). The result is passed to the handler function as a <sa href="GeoObjectCollection"/> collection, which can be placed on the map.
