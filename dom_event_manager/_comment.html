<p>
    Dom elements can generate different types of events, depending on the browser and device.
    For example, hovering the mouse over an object can generate the 'mousedown' event, and touching an item on a tablet screen can generate the 'touchstart' event.
   The Yandex.Maps API converts various browser events to a single list of events. 
   This means you can write the same code for handling dom events in all browsers and on all devices that are supported by the API.

    For a list of API events and how events are converted, see the description of the <sa href="IDomEventEmitter"/> interface.
    To subscribe to events of dom elements, use <sa href="domEvent.manager"/>.
