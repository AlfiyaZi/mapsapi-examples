    The API allows you to connect created panoramas to each other and add interactive transition elements to them.
    These elements can be standard transition arrows, or special transition markers.
    You can add an unlimited number of transition elements to the same panorama.
</p>
<p>
    To add a standard transition arrow to a panorama, redefine the getThoroughfares method in the
    panorama class. It should return an array of class instances describing
    the transition from one panorama to another (in the example, this is the Thoroughfares class). This class must specify the panorama
    to transition to and the viewing direction for this panorama. Note that you can't change display options for the arrows.
</p>
<p>
    To add transition markers to a panorama, implement the getConnections method in the panorama class.
    This method must return an array of class instances describing the transition markers
    (in the example, this is the MarkerConnection class).
    In this class, you must specify the panorama to transition to and set the display options and position
   of the marker on the panorama. In addition, transition markeres can have
    one of two states: default and hovered. You can set an icon for each of these states.
</p>
<p>
    Note that when adding a transition from one panorama to another, the reverse transition
    isn't created automatically, and you need to create it yourself.
</p>
<p>
    In this example, we created two custom panoramas and added transitions between them using standard arrows. On the first
    panorama (the one that is displayed when opening the example), we added a marker that transitions to a Yandex panorama 
    when clicked. Note that the reverse transition
    (i.e. transitioning from the Yandex panorama to the custom panorama) is not possible.
