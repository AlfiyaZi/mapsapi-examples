    This example shows how to display markers on a custom panorama.
</p>
<p>
    To add a marker to the panorama, create a class that describes the marker (in the example, this is the Marker class).
    This class must implement the <sa href="IPanoramaMarker"/> interface. In addition, add the getMarkers method to the panorama class 
    (MyPanorama in the example). This method should return instances of the Marker class.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the API doesn't have any marker images, so you have to create them yourself.
</p>
<p>
    Depending on the user's actions, the marker can have one of the following states: 'default',
    'hovered', 'expanded' or 'expandedHovered'.
</p>
<p>
    In order for the marker's appearance to change for different states, you need to define images for these states.
    The image for the 'default' state is always required.
</p>
<p>
    This example sets images for three marker states: 'default', 'hovered'
    and 'expanded'. Images for the first two states are stored on the server, and the image
    for the 'expanded' state is drawn in Canvas.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the example shows a panorama without a full vertical view.
    The <a href="/maps/doc/jsapi/2.1/dg/concepts/panoramas/panorama-manage-docpage/#not-full">documentation</a>
    discusses projecting this panorama on a sphere, and explains how to
    set the geometry of this panorama.
