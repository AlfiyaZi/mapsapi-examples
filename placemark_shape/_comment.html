<div id="references">
    <sa href="Placemark"/>,
    <sa href="templateLayoutFactory"/>
</div>
    This example creates three placemarks with their own HTML layouts. <br/>
    Custom layouts are created using the layout factory. <br/>
    All the placemarks have different hotspot shapes set: rectangle, circle, or polygon. <br/><br/>
    In order to catch mouse events, the layout uses a <a href="/maps/doc/jsapi/2.1/dg/concepts/about-hotspots.xml">hotspot</a>. <br/>
    By default, the hotspot shape isn't set when creating your own HTML layout, and you need to set it yourself.<br/>
    You can do this using the 'iconShape' layout option as a <sa href="IGeometryJson">JSON description of a geometry</sa>.
